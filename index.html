                <h2>Soup</h2>
                <p>Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made
                    by
                    combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally
                    characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted,
                    forming
                    a broth.</p>

                <h2>Thai Beef Salad</h2>
                <p>I’m probably completely biased, but I think that Asian salads are the best in the world. I love them
                    because they are interesting and the dressings are so good.The chances of me ordering a salad at any
                    restaurant other than an Asian one is almost zero.</p>

                <h2>Vegetable Salad</h2>
                <p>This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like,
                    but
                    the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli salad.
                    The
                    homemade dressing is very good on it, but so is just plain olive oil.</p>
